# Elm-frontend-project

We initially tried to make a MPSPA (Multi Page Single Page Application), 
but after many hours of unsuccessfully trying to make it work, we decided
to instead make separate modules for each endpoint that can be run individually
to test the different endpoints and see the results via Elm code.
